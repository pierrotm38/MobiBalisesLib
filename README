MobiBalisesLib is a set of java classes used by MobiBalises
(http://www.mobibalises.net) to manage alarms for weather stations.

When an alarm is raised, MobiBalises can broadcast it, so you can use
MobiBalisesLib to create your own piece of software to intercept those alarms
and treate them the way you want (send SMS, email, or whatever...).

Have fun.
